regularly

29
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:17,040
to keep in touch with the course today

30
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:19,600
will be a short class what i just want

31
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:20,960
to do today

32
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:23,360
is orient you tell you what this course

33
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:24,400
is about

34
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,920
i know this is shopping period and i

35
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:28,080
want to give you a good sense of what

36
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:30,159
you'd be in for if you took this course

37
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:31,840
i want to go over the style of the

38
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:34,400
classes the evaluation the readings and

39
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,680
so on

40
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,439
and then give some examples of some of

41
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:39,520
the specific topics that we'll be

42
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:41,840
covering

43
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:44,159
but before i get started i have to point

44
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:45,759
out something a little bit unusual about

45
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:47,600
this class

46
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,280
we are being filmed

47
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,680
this course is one of seven courses

48
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:54,479
chosen to begin the yale university open

49
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:56,399
educational resources video lecture

50
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:58,719
project

51
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:00,560
and what this means is that when the

52
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,640
year is over

53
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,560
these videos will be available on the

54
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,880
internet free for anybody who wants to

55
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:09,840
see them and ideally will be accessed by

56
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:10,959
people

57
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:13,200
across many different countries some who

58
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,280
would not normally have access to a

59
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:18,239
university education

60
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:20,400
i see this as a good and honorable use

61
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,319
of yale's resources and of course it's

62
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:24,400
also part of yale's plan for world

63
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:27,040
domination

64
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:30,319
so because of this a yale university

65
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:32,239
production team from the center of media

66
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:34,000
initiatives is going to be taping all

67
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,280
the class lectures and they're up there

68
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,440
the idea is that this should be as

69
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:42,319
unobtrusive as possible

70
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:43,840
and the classroom experience should

71
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,519
essentially be the same as if they're

72
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:48,480
not there so it's their intention to

73
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,640
tape the lectures to take me and

74
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,239
sometimes uh

75
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:55,040
the slides but not tape your faces or

76
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,800
voices so we're not having you sign

77
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,480
release forms

78
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:01,200
um two things one thing is personally

79
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,200
i have to remind myself

80
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,200
not to use profanity because children

81
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,800
may be watching so i'll try not to do

82
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:07,599
that

83
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:09,760
there's also another complexity if you

84
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:12,480
are in the front row

85
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,480
or the second row or the third row it is

86
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,879
possible that some part of your head

87
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:19,280
your back or even your face might end up

88
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,280
on film um

89
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,200
if if you are in the witness protection

90
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,400
program

91
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,720
or you're some sort of fugitive you

92
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,640
probably don't want to sit in the front

93
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,920
row

94
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,040
i'll give them if people want to

95
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,959
unobtrusively kind of slide back that's

96
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:36,159
that's fine as i'm talking

97
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:39,120
okay we're ready

98
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:40,400
so

99
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:43,120
i'd like to to um welcome people to this

100
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:45,200
course introduction to psychology my

101
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,360
name is dr paul bloom i'm professor of

102
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,519
this course

103
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:52,959
and what this is going to be

104
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:55,440
is a comprehensive introduction to the

105
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:57,680
study of the human mind

106
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:00,400
so we're going to cover a very very wide

107
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,000
range of topics

108
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,319
including brains children language sex

109
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:07,760
memory madness discuss racism and love

110
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,599
and many others we're going to talk

111
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:12,400
about things like the proper explanation

112
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:15,760
for differences between men and women

113
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,358
the question of whether animals can

114
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:19,040
learn language

115
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:21,600
the puzzle of what grosses us out the

116
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,080
problem of why some of us eat too much

117
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,400
and what we could do to stop

118
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,479
the question of why people go crazy in

119
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:30,160
groups

120
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,840
research into whether you can trust your

121
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,919
childhood memories

122
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:35,440
research into why some of us get

123
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:38,560
depressed and others don't

124
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,240
the style of this is there'll be two

125
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:43,680
lectures a week

126
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,040
as well as

127
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,400
course readings

128
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:49,120
now to do well in the course

129
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:51,520
you have to attend both the lectures and

130
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,360
do the readings there will be some

131
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,479
overlap

132
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:56,400
in some cases the lectures will be quite

133
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,080
linked to the readings but there will be

134
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,560
some parts of the readings that will not

135
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,479
find your way into lectures and some

136
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:05,040
lectures some entire lectures that will

137
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:07,440
not connect at all to the readings

138
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,320
so

139
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,479
to pursue this course properly you have

140
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:13,680
to do both um what this means is that if

141
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,000
you miss a class you need to get notes

142
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,160
and so you should get them from a friend

143
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,479
or from the person sitting next to you

144
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:22,080
the slides

145
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:24,400
are going to be made available online

146
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,080
so one of the things you don't have to

147
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:28,160
do is you don't have to write this down

148
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:30,960
you take notes any way you choose but if

149
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,800
you don't get anything on there it'll be

150
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,960
available online i'm going to post it in

151
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,880
a format which will be black and white

152
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:39,280
and easy to print out so you don't have

153
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:41,520
to worry about this but again

154
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,199
attending to the slides is not a

155
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:46,960
substitute for attending class

156
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:49,840
there's a textbook um peter gray's

157
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:52,800
psychology fifth edition

158
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,560
and there's also a collection of short

159
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,960
readings the norton reader edited by

160
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,560
gary marcus

161
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,000
it's an excellent textbook it's an

162
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
excellent collection and you should get

163
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,120
them both

164
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,600
they're available at labyrinth bookstore

165
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,600
on york street or you can get them

166
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,720
online

167
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,400
i should note that last time i taught

168
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:13,600
the course i used the marcus reader and

169
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,440
when professor marvin chun taught his

170
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,600
course last semester he used peter

171
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,759
gray's fifth edition textbook so there

172
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:21,440
may be a lot of used copies floating

173
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,520
around you should feel free to try to

174
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,600
get one of those

175
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,759
the evaluation goes like this

176
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:30,479
there is a midterm and there's a final

177
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:32,479
the final will not be held in the exam

178
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:34,400
period because i like to take long

179
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,960
vacations it will be held the last day

180
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,400
of class

181
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,560
the exams will be will be multiple

182
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,400
choice and short answer fill in the

183
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,639
blank that sort of thing prior to the

184
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:47,840
exams i will post previous exams online

185
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,919
so you have a feeling for how these

186
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:52,400
exams work and so on there will also be

187
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,400
review sessions

188
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,240
starting at the beginning of the third

189
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,240
week of class that is not next week but

190
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:01,039
the week after on monday each monday i'm

191
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:03,120
going to put up a brief question

192
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,199
or set of questions which you have to

193
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:06,240
answer

194
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,560
and your answers need to be sent to your

195
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:09,919
teaching fellow and you'll be given a

196
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:12,720
teaching fellow a signed one

197
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,160
by friday

198
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,080
this is not meant to be difficult it's

199
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,840
not meant to be more than five ten

200
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,919
minutes of work but the point of the

201
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:21,039
question

202
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:23,360
fifteen twenty minutes of work um but

203
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,599
the point of the question is to motivate

204
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:27,680
people to keep up with the material and

205
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,840
do the readings these questions will be

206
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:32,400
marked past fail i expect most everybody

207
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,720
to pass all of the questions but it's

208
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,479
just to keep you on track and keep you

209
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:37,759
going

210
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:39,840
there's a book review

211
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,520
a short book review to be written

212
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,520
towards near the end of the class i'll

213
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,280
give details about that later on in the

214
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:46,800
semester and there's also an

215
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,199
experimental participation requirement

216
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:51,120
and next week i'll i'll hand out a piece

217
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,120
of paper describing the requirement the

218
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,039
point of requirement is to give you all

219
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:56,319
experience

220
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:58,400
actually seeing what psychological

221
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,400
research is about as well as to give us

222
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,840
hundreds of subjects to do our

223
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:04,080
experiments on

224
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,360
um

225
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,520
the issue sometimes comes up as the how

226
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:10,319
to do well in the course

227
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:12,879
um here's how to do well

228
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:15,039
attend all the classes keep up with the

229
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:17,280
readings ideally keep up with the

230
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,319
readings

231
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:20,879
before you come to class

232
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:22,879
and one thing i would strongly suggest

233
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:25,039
is to form some sort of study groups

234
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:27,120
either formally or informally have

235
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:29,440
people you could talk to when the exam

236
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,520
prior to the exams are she's patting

237
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:34,000
somebody next to to her i hope you know

238
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,240
him

239
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:39,120
and um

240
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,200
and and and in fact what i'm going to do

241
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,640
not this class because the shopping

242
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,000
period i don't know who's coming next

243
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,839
class or what but i'll set up a few

244
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:47,920
minutes prior at the beginning class for

245
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,440
people just to introduce themselves to

246
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,200
the person next to them

247
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,760
so they have some sort of resource

248
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:56,080
in the class

249
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,360
now

250
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:00,000
this is a large class

251
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,839
and if you don't do anything about it it

252
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:03,839
can be very anonymous and some of you

253
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:05,600
may choose to pursue it that way and

254
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,480
it's totally fine but what i would

255
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:11,920
suggest you do is establish some contact

256
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:14,560
with us either with me or with any of

257
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,160
the teaching fellows and i'll introduce

258
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:18,880
the teaching fellows sometime next week

259
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,959
um you could talk to us at the beginning

260
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:22,399
or the end of class

261
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:24,240
unless there's special circumstances i

262
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,440
always try to come

263
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,040
at least 10 minutes early and i try and

264
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,800
i'm willing to stay late to talk to

265
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,000
people

266
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,839
you could come by during my office hours

267
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:33,519
which are on the syllabus and you can

268
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:36,080
send me email and set up an appointment

269
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,920
i'm very willing to talk to students

270
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,760
about intellectual ideas about course

271
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:42,240
problems and so on and if you see me at

272
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,080
some point just on campus

273
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:46,399
you could introduce yourself and i i'd

274
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:49,600
like to meet people from this class

275
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:52,080
so again a lot of stress you have the

276
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,680
option of staying anonymous in this

277
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:55,200
class but you also have the option of

278
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,560
seeking out and making some sort of

279
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,880
contact with us

280
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,720
okay

281
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:03,360
that's the formal stuff of the course

282
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,839
what's this course about

283
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:08,720
um unlike a lot of other courses some

284
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,880
people come to intro psychology with

285
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:13,040
some unusual motivations

286
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:15,600
um maybe you're crazy

287
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:19,800
and hope to become less crazy

288
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:21,680
maybe you want to learn how to study

289
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:24,160
better improve your sex life interpret

290
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:26,079
your dreams and win friends and

291
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:28,959
influence people

292
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:31,279
those are not necessarily bad reasons to

293
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:32,800
take

294
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,880
this course and with the exception of

295
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,560
the sex part

296
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:38,240
this course might actually help you out

297
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:40,160
with some of these things the study of

298
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,640
scientific psychology has a lot of

299
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:45,200
insights of real world relevance to real

300
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:47,360
problems that we face in our everyday

301
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,279
lives and i want to try and when these

302
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:50,560
issues come up i'm going to try to

303
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:52,880
stress them and and and make you try to

304
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,720
think about the extent to which the

305
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,399
laboratory research i'll be talking

306
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:58,959
about can affect your everyday life how

307
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:01,040
you study how you interact with people

308
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:03,360
how you might try to persuade somebody

309
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,600
of something else what sort of therapy

310
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:08,240
works best for you

311
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:11,600
but the general goals of this course

312
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:12,880
are actually

313
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:16,959
i think even more interesting than that

314
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,959
what i want to do is provide a

315
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:20,880
state-of-the-art introduction to the

316
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:23,360
most important topic that there is

317
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,160
um

318
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:24,959
us

319
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:28,000
how the human mind works how we think

320
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,240
what makes us what we are

321
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,680
and we'll be approaching this from a

322
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,920
range of directions so traditionally

323
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:36,160
psychology is often broken up into the

324
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:39,440
following in into five sub areas

325
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:42,000
neuroscience which is the study of the

326
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,200
of the mind by looking at the brain

327
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,440
developmental which is the area which i

328
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,839
focus mostly on which is trying to learn

329
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:52,240
about how people develop and grow and

330
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:54,320
learn

331
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,519
cognitive

332
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:57,279
which is the one term of the five that

333
00:11:57,279 --> 00:11:58,959
might be unfamiliar to some of you but

334
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:00,880
it refers to a sort of computational

335
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:03,680
approach to studying the mind often

336
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:06,399
viewing the mind on analogy with a

337
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:08,480
computer and looking at how people do

338
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,399
things like understand language

339
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:12,240
recognize objects

340
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,480
play games and so on

341
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:16,399
there is social

342
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:18,240
which is the study of how people act in

343
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:21,200
groups how people act with other people

344
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,600
and there is clinical which is maybe the

345
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,200
aspect of psychology that people think

346
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,200
of immediately when they hear psychology

347
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,040
which is a study of mental health and

348
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,480
mental illness

349
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,560
and we'll be covering all of those areas

350
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:34,399
we'll also be covering a set of related

351
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:35,600
areas

352
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:38,079
i am convinced that you cannot study the

353
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:39,519
mind

354
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:41,600
solely by looking at the discipline of

355
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,760
psychology discipline psychology spills

356
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:46,399
over to issues of how the mind has

357
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:48,000
evolved

358
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,480
economics and game theory

359
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,800
are now an essential tools for

360
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,560
understanding human thought and human

361
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:56,560
behavior there's issues connecting to

362
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:58,880
philosophy computer science anthropology

363
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:01,440
literature theology and many many other

364
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:02,880
domains

365
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:05,760
so this course will be wide-ranging in

366
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,279
that sense

367
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:09,360
um at this point i've been speaking in

368
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,200
generalities so

369
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:14,240
i want to close this introductory class

370
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:16,480
by giving five examples

371
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,720
of the sorts of topics we'll be covering

372
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,880
and i'll start the topic that we'll be

373
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:23,519
covering next week on monday

374
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:25,279
the brain

375
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:27,600
um this is a brain

376
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:31,839
in fact it's a specific person's brain

377
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:33,680
and what's interesting about the brain

378
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:37,120
is that little white mark there

379
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,880
it's her brain

380
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:41,120
it's terri schiavo's brain

381
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,120
you recognize her more from pictures

382
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,800
like that

383
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:47,519
and what a case like this where somebody

384
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:48,639
um

385
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:49,760
is is

386
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:52,480
in a coma is without consciousness

387
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:54,800
as a result of damage to the brain is a

388
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:57,199
stark illustration of the physical

389
00:13:57,199 --> 00:13:59,120
nature of mental life

390
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:01,040
the physical basis for everything that

391
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:04,320
we normally hold dear like free will

392
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,600
consciousness

393
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,760
morality and emotions

394
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,040
and that's what we'll begin the course

395
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:12,160
with talking about how a physical thing

396
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:16,399
can give rise to mental life

397
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:19,040
we'll talk a lot about children

398
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:21,680
this is actually a specific child it's

399
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:25,519
uh my son zachary my younger son um

400
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:27,920
dressed up as super as spider-man but it

401
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:31,839
is halloween no it's not halloween oh

402
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:33,120
no

403
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:36,000
there's more to say about that um

404
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,120
i study child development for a living

405
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:41,199
and i'm interested in several questions

406
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:43,120
so one question is just a question of

407
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:45,839
development everybody in this room

408
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:48,480
can speak and understand english

409
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,240
everybody in this room has some

410
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:52,160
understanding of how the world works how

411
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:54,560
physical things behave everybody in this

412
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:55,839
room has some understanding of other

413
00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:59,920
people and how people behave

414
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:01,199
and the question

415
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:03,279
that that preoccupies developmental

416
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:05,360
psychologists is how do we come to have

417
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:06,480
this knowledge

418
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:09,440
and in particular how much of it is

419
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:12,560
hardwired built in innate and how much

420
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:14,560
of it is a product of culture

421
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:17,839
of of language of schooling

422
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:20,480
and developmental psychologists use

423
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,480
many ingenious methods to try to pull

424
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:23,920
these apart

425
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:26,000
and and try to figure out what what as

426
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,360
what's what's

427
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,839
what are the basic components of human

428
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:31,600
nature

429
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:35,760
there's also the question of continuity

430
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:39,760
to what extent is zachary at that age

431
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:41,760
going to be

432
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:43,360
that way forever

433
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:46,000
to what extent is your fate sealed

434
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,480
to what extent could if i were to meet

435
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,639
you when you were five years old

436
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:54,639
i could describe the way you are now

437
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:56,399
the poet

438
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:58,000
william wordsworth

439
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,920
wrote

440
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:02,639
the child is father to the man

441
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:05,600
and what this means is that you can see

442
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:08,480
within every child the adult he or she

443
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:11,040
will become

444
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:13,199
we will look and and ask the question

445
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:15,279
whether this is true is it true for your

446
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:17,519
personality is it true for your interest

447
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:21,279
is it true for your intelligence

448
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,360
another question having to do with

449
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:25,600
development

450
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:26,480
is

451
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:29,279
what makes us the way we are

452
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:31,839
we're different in a lot of ways

453
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:33,680
the people in this room differ according

454
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:34,480
to

455
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:36,000
their taste and food they differ

456
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,639
according to their iqs whether they're

457
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:40,560
aggressive or shy

458
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,320
whether they're attracted to males

459
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:45,360
females both or neither whether

460
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,360
whether they're good at music

461
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:48,639
whether

462
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:50,160
they're politically liberal or

463
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:51,680
conservative

464
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,680
why are we different what's the

465
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:56,000
explanation for why we're different

466
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,560
and again this could be translated in

467
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:00,399
terms of a question of genes and

468
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:03,120
environment to what extent are things

469
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,039
the result of the genes we possess to

470
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:08,079
what extent are our our individual

471
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:10,240
nature as a result of how we were raised

472
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:12,079
and to what extent are they best

473
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:15,039
explained in terms of an interaction um

474
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:17,839
one common theory for instance is that

475
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:19,839
we are shaped by our parents

476
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:22,240
um this was best summarized most

477
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:24,559
famously by the british poet phillip

478
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:26,799
larkin

479
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:28,720
who wrote

480
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:31,280
they they messed you up

481
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:33,600
your mum and dad

482
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:36,480
they may not mean to but they do

483
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,960
they fill you with the faults they had

484
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:42,480
and add some extra just for you

485
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:43,840
is he right

486
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:46,720
it's very controversial you it's been a

487
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:49,039
series of a huge controversy in a

488
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:51,440
popular culture to the extent to which

489
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:52,799
parents matter

490
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:54,000
and this is an issue which will

491
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:58,160
preoccupy us for much of the course

492
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,960
a different question what makes somebody

493
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,480
attractive

494
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:04,080
and this can be asked at all sorts of

495
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:06,640
levels but a symbol level is

496
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:09,120
what makes for a pretty face

497
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:10,480
so these are

498
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:13,520
according to ratings very attractive

499
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:14,799
faces

500
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:17,200
they are not the faces of real people

501
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,640
what's on the screen are computer

502
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,160
generated faces

503
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:22,880
um of a caucasian male and a caucasian

504
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:27,280
female who don't exist in the real world

505
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:30,160
but through using this sort of computer

506
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,559
generation and then asking people what

507
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:34,000
they think of this face what they think

508
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,840
of that face scientists have come to

509
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,520
some sense as to what really makes a

510
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:39,280
face attractive

511
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:42,559
both within cultures and across cultures

512
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:43,600
and that's something which we're going

513
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,919
to devote some time to when we talk

514
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:48,000
about social behavior and in particular

515
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,960
when we talk about sex

516
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:53,280
not all attractiveness not all beauty of

517
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:56,240
course is linked to sex

518
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:58,080
so

519
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:00,640
so pandas for instance like this panda

520
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,720
are notoriously cute

521
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,400
and i don't

522
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,000
i don't have anything to say about it

523
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:10,039
really it's just a cute picture

524
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:14,000
um morality

525
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,480
is extremely

526
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:18,240
central to our lives

527
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,919
and a deep question which we will

528
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:21,360
struggle with throughout most of the

529
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,760
course is the question of good and evil

530
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:26,480
evil and good um these three pictures

531
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:29,440
exemplify different sorts of of evil

532
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:32,480
what you call institutional evil

533
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:35,840
um by somebody um

534
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:38,400
behaving cruelly or towards somebody for

535
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,160
somebody else perhaps not due to malice

536
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:42,080
but because of the situation that she's

537
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:45,760
in it has a picture of osama bin laden

538
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:47,679
a mass murderer driven by political

539
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:49,600
cause and then there's this guy on the

540
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:53,720
bottom anybody know who he is

541
00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:57,200
ted bundy who got that

542
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,039
film that man no

543
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:00,480
ted bundy

544
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:03,200
exactly and that's like

545
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:04,720
before we get into the technicals that's

546
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:06,640
like crazy evil

547
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,559
and and and we're going to have to come

548
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:10,320
to terms

549
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:13,200
with why some people are like that

550
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:16,080
and again the same situation comes up is

551
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:18,400
it part of your nature

552
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:21,600
to be good or bad um

553
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:24,320
or is it largely due to the situation

554
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:26,320
that you that you've fallen

555
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:27,760
and there's a lot of some

556
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:30,000
quite spectacular experiments that try

557
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,200
to tease that

558
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:33,440
apart um if we're going to talk about

559
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:36,960
evil we should also talk about good

560
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:37,919
um

561
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:40,960
this is these are pictures of um of two

562
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:42,960
notoriously good men

563
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:49,120
um oscar schindler and paul russessa but

564
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:53,440
each who at different times in history

565
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:55,760
saved the lives of many many people at

566
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:58,880
great risk to themselves

567
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:02,559
schindler and the holocaust um and and

568
00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:04,480
and then the other guy in

569
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:06,400
in um could i can't pronounce his name

570
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,559
recessive again

571
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:09,919
in rwanda

572
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:12,080
and they both had real good movies made

573
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:13,039
about them

574
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:14,720
um

575
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:16,880
and and so but what's interesting with

576
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,720
these cases is you couldn't have

577
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,799
predicted ahead of time

578
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:23,039
that they would be heroes

579
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:25,200
and one personal issue within any of us

580
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,440
is what would we do

581
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:30,640
in such situations

582
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:32,559
finally

583
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:34,000
throughout this course

584
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,880
we will discuss mental illness

585
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:37,679
now

586
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:39,200
towards the end of the class i want to

587
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,880
devote a full week

588
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:43,440
to discussing major or disorders like

589
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:45,360
depression and anxiety

590
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:47,039
because of their profound social

591
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:49,440
importance

592
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:51,200
such disorders are reasonably common in

593
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:52,880
college students

594
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:55,039
many people in this room are currently

595
00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:57,520
suffering from a mood disorder an

596
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:59,919
anxiety disorder or both

597
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:02,240
and i won't ask for a show of hands but

598
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,400
i know a lot of people in this room are

599
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,880
on some form of medication for this

600
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:08,000
disorder

601
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,640
um and we'll discuss we'll discuss the

602
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:12,720
current research and why people get

603
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:15,280
these disorders and what's the best way

604
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:17,039
to make them better

605
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:19,360
but i also have a weakness

606
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:22,320
for the less common mental disorders

607
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:23,919
that i think tell us something really

608
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:26,799
interesting about mental life

609
00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:28,960
so when we talk about memory for

610
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:31,200
instance we'll talk about disorders in

611
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:33,440
memory including some disorders that

612
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:35,600
keep you from forming new memories as

613
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:38,159
well as or disorders of amnesia where

614
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:40,720
you forget the past and these are

615
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:42,559
extraordinarily interesting for all

616
00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:45,919
sorts of reasons

617
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:48,159
early in the course in fact i think next

618
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:49,039
week

619
00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:51,120
we will discuss no later on in the

620
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:52,320
course the middle of middle of the

621
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:54,559
semester we will discuss the amazing

622
00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:56,880
case of phineas gage

623
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,880
phineas gage was a construction worker

624
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:00,720
about 100 years ago

625
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:03,840
due to an explosion a metal pipe went

626
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:06,840
through his head like so

627
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:09,600
miraculously he was not killed

628
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:10,640
in fact

629
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:12,320
his friends it went through his head

630
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:14,240
when ended up a hundred feet away

631
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:16,799
covered with brains and blood

632
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:19,600
and phineas gays sat down and oh

633
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,840
and then on the way to the hospital they

634
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:24,080
stopped by a pub

635
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:26,960
have some cider

636
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:30,240
he was not blind he was not deaf he was

637
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:33,280
not

638
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:37,120
but something else happened to him

639
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:40,240
he lost his sense of right and wrong

640
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:43,200
he lost his control

641
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:47,120
he used to be a hard-working family man

642
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:49,440
after an accident he lost all of that

643
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:51,679
he couldn't hold a job he couldn't stay

644
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:53,200
faithful to his wife

645
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:55,120
he couldn't speak for five minutes

646
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:56,559
without cursing

647
00:23:56,559 --> 00:23:58,960
he got into fights he got into brawls he

648
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:01,520
got drunk he lost his control

649
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:04,480
he ended up on a circus sideshow

650
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:06,080
traveling through the country with the

651
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:07,600
big steel pipe that went through his

652
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:09,280
head

653
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:10,880
and this is again

654
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:14,080
an extraordinary example of how the the

655
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:16,480
brain can give rise to the mind and how

656
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:17,919
things that go wrong the brain can

657
00:24:17,919 --> 00:24:20,880
affect you in in a serious way

658
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,400
we'll discuss

659
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:25,039
cases of multiple personality disorder

660
00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:26,480
where people have more than one

661
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:28,880
personality and also discuss the debate

662
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:30,960
over what's whether such cases are true

663
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:33,279
or not whether they can be taken as a

664
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:35,840
real phenomena or a made-up phenomena

665
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,279
which is there's a matter of a lot of

666
00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:39,440
controversy and then we'll even discuss

667
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:42,559
some rarer cases

668
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:45,520
like cap grass syndrome

669
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:48,880
cup grass syndrome is typically is is

670
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:51,120
there's hundreds of cases not many

671
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:52,880
hundreds of cases it's typically the

672
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:55,120
result of some sort of stroke

673
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:57,919
and what happens to you is very specific

674
00:24:57,919 --> 00:25:00,400
you develop a particular

675
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:01,840
delusion

676
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:04,799
like it's getting dark

677
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:07,679
and

678
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:10,320
the delusion

679
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:14,240
is that the people you love the most

680
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:16,480
have been replaced

681
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:18,799
they've been replaced by aliens or

682
00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:20,159
robots

683
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:22,799
thank you um by by

684
00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:25,279
by martians by cia agents by trained

685
00:25:25,279 --> 00:25:29,840
actors and actresses but the people

686
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:33,520
but the idea is the people you care for

687
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:36,799
the most you believe are gone

688
00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:37,919
and

689
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:40,080
this could lead to tragic consequences

690
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:42,559
cop grass syndrome is associated with a

691
00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:45,120
very high level of violence

692
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:47,279
one man in australia a couple of years

693
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:49,360
ago was under the delusion that his

694
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:51,600
father was replaced with a robot and cut

695
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:54,159
off his head

696
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:56,400
a related disorder

697
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:58,480
involving the very same parts of the

698
00:25:58,480 --> 00:25:59,600
brain

699
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:03,200
is called katard's syndrome and katarn

700
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:06,880
syndrome is you believe that you're dead

701
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:08,559
you believe that you're dead you you are

702
00:26:08,559 --> 00:26:09,679
persuaded that you're dead you're

703
00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:10,880
walking around you know you're walking

704
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:12,000
around you know you that there are

705
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,720
people around um but you think that

706
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:15,760
you're dead

707
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:18,000
and what's striking about these is it's

708
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,760
not these are not just sort of big

709
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:22,000
screwy problems of messed up people

710
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,240
rather they're located they're related

711
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:26,080
at a pinpoint level

712
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:28,159
to certain parts of your brain

713
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:29,679
and we're going to talk about the best

714
00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:31,520
modern theories as to why these

715
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:33,520
syndromes occur

716
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:35,279
now

717
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:36,960
the reason to be interested in them

718
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:39,760
again is not because they're frequent

719
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:41,840
they aren't and it's not because of some

720
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:45,440
sort of gruesome morbid curiosity rather

721
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:49,360
by looking at extreme cases

722
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:52,799
they can help us best understand

723
00:26:52,799 --> 00:26:54,000
normal life

724
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,159
often by looking at extremes it throws

725
00:26:56,159 --> 00:26:58,559
into sharp contrast things we naturally

726
00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:00,559
take for granted the issue of

727
00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:02,080
psychopathy

728
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:04,159
of people who either do the brain damage

729
00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:06,400
or because they're born that way have no

730
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:09,200
moral understanding can help us

731
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:10,799
cope with questions of free will and

732
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:13,440
responsibility of the relationship or

733
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:15,039
difference between mental illness and

734
00:27:15,039 --> 00:27:18,480
evil multiple personality cases force us

735
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:20,159
to address the question of what is a

736
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:21,520
self

737
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:24,159
what to what extent do are all of us

738
00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:26,320
composed of multiple people

739
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:28,400
and to what extent are we a single

740
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:31,039
unified person over time cases like cop

741
00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:33,200
grass

742
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:35,279
are important because they tell us about

743
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:37,440
how we see the world they tell us for

744
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:38,720
instance that there's a difference

745
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:40,799
between recognizing something in a sense

746
00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:42,240
that you could name it

747
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:45,039
and knowing what it is

748
00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:47,200
and and and so by studying these

749
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:49,440
abnormal cases we get some insight into

750
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:51,200
regular life

751
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:53,440
so that's the end of the illustration of

752
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:55,200
the example topics

753
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:58,559
the syllabus lists many more

754
00:27:58,559 --> 00:28:01,440
i'll end by telling you

755
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:03,840
that

756
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:05,760
there's a there's a lot of stuff that

757
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:07,520
we'll be talking about that i want to

758
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:10,640
