to keep in touch with the course today

30
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:19,600
will be a short class what i just want

31
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:20,960
to do today

32
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:23,360
is orient you tell you what this course

33
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:24,400
is about

34
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,920
i know this is shopping period and i

35
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:28,080
want to give you a good sense of what

36
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:30,159
you'd be in for if you took this course

37
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:31,840
i want to go over the style of the

38
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:34,400
classes the evaluation the readings and

39
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,680
so on

40
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,439
and then give some examples of some of

41
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:39,520
the specific topics that we'll be

42
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:41,840
covering

43
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:44,159
but before i get started i have to point

44
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:45,759
out something a little bit unusual about

45
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:47,600
this class

46
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,280
we are being filmed

47
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,680
this course is one of seven courses

48
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:54,479
chosen to begin the yale university open

49
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:56,399
educational resources video lecture

50
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:58,719
project

51
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:00,560
and what this means is that when the

52
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,640
year is over

53
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,560
these videos will be available on the

54
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,880
internet free for anybody who wants to

55
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:09,840
see them and ideally will be accessed by

56
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:10,959
people

57
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:13,200
across many different countries some who

58
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,280
would not normally have access to a

59
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:18,239
university education

60
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:20,400
i see this as a good and honorable use

61
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,319
of yale's resources and of course it's

62
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:24,400
also part of yale's plan for world

63
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:27,040
domination

64
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:30,319
so because of this a yale university

65
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:32,239
production team from the center of media

66
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:34,000
initiatives is going to be taping all

67
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,280
the class lectures and they're up there

68
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,440
the idea is that this should be as

69
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:42,319
unobtrusive as possible

70
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:43,840
and the classroom experience should

71
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,519
essentially be the same as if they're

72
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:48,480
not there so it's their intention to

73
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,640
tape the lectures to take me and

74
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,239
sometimes uh

75
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:55,040
the slides but not tape your faces or

76
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,800
voices so we're not having you sign

77
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,480
release forms

78
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:01,200
um two things one thing is personally

79
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,200
i have to remind myself

80
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,200
not to use profanity because children

81
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,800
may be watching so i'll try not to do

82
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:07,599
that

83
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:09,760
there's also another complexity if you

84
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:12,480
are in the front row

85
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,480
or the second row or the third row it is

86
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,879
possible that some part of your head
